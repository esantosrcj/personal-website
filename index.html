                            <p>Hello, my name is Eddie and I’m a Software Engineer living in Lawrence, Kansas. I grew up in Kansas City, Kansas and graduated from the University of Kansas, where I got my Engineering degree. Rock Chalk!</p>
                            <p>In my career, I’m passionate about creating software that makes people’s daily lives easier. One of the many things I enjoy about the software industry is being surrounded by brilliant people. There is a sense of camaraderie that develops when working with teammates, where we listen to each other’s input and share our visions to all achieve the same goal.</p>
                            <p>As a first-generation college graduate whose parents moved here to give me a better life, I don’t take for granted the education and opportunities I’ve been given. I am constantly trying to better myself, inside and outside of work. I’ve learned so many different technologies in my free time – most recently, Python. It’s important to me to continue to improve my skills and view things in a different light. There are still so many new technologies I want to learn, and I’m working through my list!</p>
                            <p>Outside of my professional career, I enjoy traveling with my wife. One of my favorite recent (pre-pandemic) trips was to Munich for Oktoberfest, and I’m hoping to make it to Japan sometime soon. I like to hang out with my friends, watch movies, listen to music and play board games. I am also an avid KC sports fanatic! Go Chiefs!</p>

The company is one of the top mutual insurance companies in the region, serving nearly 1 million people with more than 17 million health claims processed in 2020. I recently advised, as a Subject Matter Expert, in the migration to Git as the company’s new version control tool. I’m currently working on building new REST APIs for internal business partners.</p>

The application is used heavily and consistently in large, populous school districts. It was another legacy application that needed a major update to stay competitive in the K-12 industry. I worked within in a small team tasked with creating REST APIs that would be used by mobile application, and eventually a web application, for the absence management application.</p>

During my time there, I developed on an industry-leading applicant tracking solution for the K-12 industry as part of a service-oriented architecture, accessed by hundreds of school districts across the nation. I also worked on another K-12 industry application, contributing to the design and architecture to modernize the IVR service used to identify the most qualified substitute. I was solely responsible for the majority of the work for the modernization of the IVR service.</p>
